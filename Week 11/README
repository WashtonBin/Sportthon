# Flask-based MCP Server with SQLite Application

This project provides a Flask-based API for processing uploaded CSV files to SQLite and querying a knowledge base using OpenAI's GPT model, OpenAI SDK

Before running this project, you must install npm, node.js, and uv.
## Files Overview

### 1. `app.py`

- **`/create_table`**: Generate your own sql query to fetch the data
- **`/'/sqlite'`**: Read csv files and load data to SQLite


#### Key Features:
- using OpenAI SDK and FastMCP Server.
- Load CSV files to database automatically `sqlie.py.py`.
- No SQL knowledge users also can build table and fetch data with prompts.

#### How to Run:
```bash
python app.py

Open the postman
/create_table
file  "CSV files"
query create a database in "YOUR_FOLDER_NAME". table name is "YOUR_TABLE_NAME", database name is "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME". load "YOUR_FOLDER_NAME" from the uploads folder


/sqlite
query   fetch all data in database name ""YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"" and table name "YOUR_TABLE_NAME"

NOTE: USERS must provide correct table name, database name, and which columns or rows they want to fetch data because this application is in case sensitive.
